# Pyber_Analysis
Module 5 Pyber with Matplotlib Charting for Ride Share services


## Project Purpose

The goal of this exercise was to analyze two data sources, combine them, and determine the overall performance of three different market locations on driver profits / fares / rides across the ride share industry.  This is useful to choose the best place for further investments, where drivers have the most ability to make money, and shows where changes may be necessary.

## Analysis Results

It is unsurpring given the locations and availability of rides, that locations closer to metropolitan areas have the highest number of total rides.  As shown below, rural has a low total count of 125 rides across 78 drivers which Urban areas have 1625 rides across 2405 drivers.  This does however mean that drivers who are willing to perform in rural areas receive larger fares due to greater distances between locations, and fewer competitive drivers.  Urban areas suffer from having more drivers then there are available fares in a given time.

The graph below is another easy to understand picture showing the total amount spent in each location over time.  If the company is focusing on pure volume, it is hard to compete with the dense population of rides needed in a city / urban area.

## Summary

From the perspective of the company, Urban areas hold the most value due to the sheer number of drivers / rides necessary to support it.  While the cost per ride is lower, this is due to higher competition with drivers and far shorter rides than Suburban or Rural destinations.  However, some balance must be met as drivers may see their coworkers reaching higher per ride profits in rural or suburban areas.  More analysis is necessary to reach final conclusions.
